                            My task in the project was to find statistics , make moodboard, personas and sketch for our redesign of logo. In the logo there was a
                            focus on the Japanese flag and the turtle shield with a belt on as it should symbolize the martial art. I also got to code Den Hurtige Skildpaddes about page.

                            Our challenge with the project was that it was not our own code we were sitting with, which was difficult to work with as they had not coded in the same way as we would have done.

                            Our challenge in the project was a lot of coding, as we wanted to make a really cool webshop page, which we had difficulty coding. In addition we did not make it responsive. We also had challenges when we were going out to film, as we had expected to find a lot of rubbish on a beach but basically did not find anything. But it blew a lot that day and it was cold which made it difficult to get filmed in longer time. We were also a bit under time pressure in the end, so we decided that we did not have time to photoshop more shop photos as it takes a long time.
